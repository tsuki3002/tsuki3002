# Hi, I’m Sushma 👋

**Fueling data-driven adventures: from raw numbers to agentic AI.**

I’m a data fanatic with a Master’s in Advanced Data Analytics (UNT ’25) who lives for uncovering insights and building intelligent systems. Currently diving into agentic AI, LLM design, and API‑driven workflows. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me crocheting cozy creations, lost in a good novel, or blazing new trails on a hike.

## 🔭 Projects

- **Independent AI Researcher – Ongoing**  
  Exploring agentic AI systems like LangChain and AutoGen; building experimental workflows to evaluate LLM behavior and prompt optimization techniques. 

- **Data Analysis of Biomechanical Movements Using IMU Sensors** (Dec 2024)  
  Conducted comprehensive data collection, preprocessing, and EDA of IMU sensor data to study hip, knee, and ankle movements using Python, IMU sensor kits, SciPy, Matplotlib, and machine learning (KNN, SVM).

- **Carbon Emissions Prediction and Analysis** (Dec 2023)  
  Collected and processed carbon emissions data to build predictive models with Python, Pandas, Scikit‑Learn, and Jupyter Notebook, providing actionable insights for sustainability efforts.

- **Heart Rate Monitoring and Data Analysis for Emergency Response** (Apr 2023)  
  Developed real‑time sensor data pipelines and algorithms in Python and Arduino to detect abnormal pulses, integrating Bluetooth modules for instant alerts and improving emergency response.

- **Analytics Capstone: Allegheny County Motor Vehicle Crash Analysis** (May 2025)  
  Applied data preprocessing, clustering, classification, and time series forecasting on Allegheny County crash data (2020‑2023) to identify high‑risk roads, factors influencing Pennsylvania State Police investigations, and weather‑driven collision trends using Python, Pandas, Scikit‑Learn, Microsoft Azure, and Power BI.
